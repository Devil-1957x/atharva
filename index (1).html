  <header>Bhopal Gas Tragedy</header>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p><strong>Date and Location:</strong> The Bhopal disaster occurred on December 3, 1984, in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India.</p>

    <p><strong>Chemical Leak:</strong> Around 45 tons of methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas leaked from an insecticide plant owned by Union Carbide Corporation.</p>

    <p><strong>Immediate Impact:</strong> The gas spread over densely populated areas, killing thousands of people instantly and causing a mass panic.</p>

    <h1>Cause Of Disaster</h1>

    <p><strong>Corporate Negligence:</strong> The disaster was partially attributed to decaying facilities, lack of safety culture, and an undertrained workforce, allowing water to enter the MIC tanks.</p>

    <p><strong>Underinvestment in Safety:</strong> Management and local authorities were criticized for underinvesting in safety measures, which led to inoperable safety systems, such as turning off the MIC tank refrigeration system.</p>

    <p><strong>Safety and Maintenance Issues:</strong> Overfilling of MIC tanks, poor maintenance, and inoperable safety devices due to cost-cutting and reduced skilled staff were major factors that exacerbated the disaster.</p>

    <p><strong>Worker Sabotage Theory:</strong> An alternative theory suggests that a rogue employee deliberately introduced water into the MIC tanks, a scenario that some believe was covered up by the Indian government to shift the blame.</p>

    <h1>Background</h1>

    <p><strong>UCIL Factory Construction:</strong> Built in 1969 to produce the pesticide Sevin, with MIC used as an intermediate.</p>

    <p><strong>MIC Production Addition:</strong> In 1979, an MIC production plant was added to the site to enhance production efficiency.</p>

    <p><strong>Chemical Process:</strong> The process involved methylamine reacting with phosgene to produce MIC, which then reacted with 1-naphthol to form carbaryl.</p>

    <p><strong>Alternative Methods:</strong> Other manufacturers like Bayer produced carbaryl without using MIC, though at higher manufacturing costs.</p>

    <p><strong>Excess MIC Accumulation:</strong> Despite reduced demand in the early 1980s, unused MIC accumulated at the Bhopal plant, increasing risks.</p>

    <h1>Lesson Learned</h1>

    <p><strong>Industrialization Risks:</strong> Expanding industrialization in developing countries without evolving safety regulations can lead to catastrophic outcomes, as seen in Bhopal.</p>

    <p><strong>Global Market Ties:</strong> The Bhopal disaster highlighted that local industrial hazards are often influenced by global market dynamics, such as UCC's pursuit of the growing Indian pesticide market.</p>

    <p><strong>Double Standards:</strong> The execution of UCC's project in India suggested a double standard in safety practices for multinational corporations operating in developing countries.</p>

    <p><strong>Need for International Standards:</strong> Enforceable international regulations could improve safety in hazardous industries by providing uniform safety benchmarks for companies worldwide.</p>

    <p><strong>Weak Infrastructure:</strong> In 1984, Bhopal's weak public health infrastructure and lack of basic services made it ill-equipped to handle industrial accidents, emphasizing the need for strong local systems before hosting hazardous industries.</p>
